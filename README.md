# hello-world
Just another repository.

Mr. B here.  I'm a family man with several hobbies, such as running, swimming, and biking.  I mostly run these days.
I've been to many countries - from S. America, Europe, and Asia.

I am attempting to educate myself with the GitHub application so that I main increase my knowledge, skills, and abilities and hopefully gain insight into the wonderful world of Web Application Development and Programming.  Ultimately, completing the WADP Course at FMTC and finding employment that allows me to work as little as possible in an office (other than my home-office).
