# hello-world
Just another repository.

Mr. B is a family man with several hobbies, such as running, swimming, and biking.  I mostly run these days.
I've been to many countries - from S. America, Europe, and Asia.

This is Mr. B. again.

I'm playing around with GitHub to gain experience and attempt to understand the "How to" use this platform.
With God's help, I will gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to complete the Web Application Development and Programming course.
